This is the first of the characters included in the character pack Unique Freaks!
I feel like I may regret this in the future but whatever, feel free to host this as long as its not edited (without my permission,) please dont steal these sprites and call it your own... thats a jerkhead stinkypoopoo head move.

Since this is in open beta this wall of text will be left here and list the planned features.

**Already added features (may need tweaks)**
Super theme (Credits To NokNox8413)
Time Stone Graphic (Credits To Zxohy)

**Planned Features/Tweaks**
Fix super transformation mid areotide

Areotide is much stronger or weaker than it should be depending on scale

Fix NIGHTS rotation and softlocking opon touching a Nights booster

Add the hurt signpost for battlemod (if possible)

Add a toggle for the reaction hud (ie disable automatically if bm v10 or mystic realm is loaded)

Bm grounded air dogde, and sprites for airparry.

Air Parry reverses 10% of momentum and has the dedicated sprites.

Make Areotide have different levels of bm prio depending on charge.

Remove long deprecated print functions

Make air parry and springs cancel areotide

Make max charge areotide break walls, break spikes, and work with momentum mods (like mystic realm)

Using sprites (maybe a spinning the skid animation) for the charge jump

Dodging an attack should cancel areotide

Wind fof resistance

(if possible maybe 1.25x longer breath underwater?) 

Fixing SKID

Super form is called Chrono in the emerald screen

Chrono form can fly like in ERZ (egg reverie) (spin to descend, jump to ascend, press both at the same time to boost forward)  Hitting a pit or a instakill Virdis will hold out the timestone (Ill make the sprites for dis), warp to the nearest safe spot (can be a checkpoint) and have a twenty ring deduction. Air vault will propel Virdis forwards instead of backwards and have the feathers home in on badnicks (Akin to the terraprisma from terraria, feel free to use rainbow trails thats made of the feather sprites)

Make feathers auto despawn after 5 seconds to disable them being stuck in goop and being lag machines

(make rebound less of a nussance and not occur after state changes and crap, maybe bounce like mighty from sonic mania with the control lock?) 


**BATTLE planned features **

**Midair**
**Swirl Stun**
Cost 10 Rings
CD 2 Seconds
Virdis will have a short windup and flap his wings (just reuse running) and release 3 projectiles with tumbling similar to vectors fully charged BM move that will cause contact damage with a wall or collision (Akin to mightys megaton)

"Final draft" for air bm move

**Grounded**
**Turbulent Trap**
Cost 35 Rings
CD 9 Seconds
Virdis will make a whirlwind animation around himself and make a shield with the pros of a arma and a whirlwind shield. (When used it will cause hard tumbling) and has a bit more of a startup than an average arma and flings Virdis upwards in a nonfree state to allow counter/punishment for using it in a bad placement.
(Can be used in fall and spring states)


Air parry EX
Allow areotide to be used again after a successful parry for follow-ups (only once though)

Grounded Dodge
Make the airdodge just function like megaman Xs dash, with iframes and all with slow falling whilst its in effect
